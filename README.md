核心理论：The optimization  process can be viewed as an animal, following the optimal  foraging theory, foraging in different patches to find the  optimal patch where the net rate of energy gain can be  maximized. After the optimal patch is found, the animal will  search the optimal position within the patch according to the  model of the best prey.

the individual is regarded as a foraging animal whose  position in a patch denotes a solution of the objective function

According to the Optimal Foraging Theory,  animals always forage in the area of greatest food abundance  and always allocate most foraging time to the patch of greatest  food

The animal foraging position is expressed by a  two-dimensional variable of longitude and latitude and can  move along the two directions.

The position in OFA is  expressed by a d-dimensional variable;

**According to the optimal foraging theory, animals always  allocate the greatest amount of time to the patch of greatest food  abundance and progressively less time to progressively worse  areas**

The marginal value theorem of optimal foraging  theory states that an animal should **leave a patch when its rate of  food intake in the patch drops to the average rate of the habitat**
